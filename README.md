# Framer Tutorial

##Introduction

Framer.js (Framer) is a prototyping tool that allows UX designers to create interactive animated prototypes.

This lesson guide is adapted from [David Lee‘s](https://twitter.com/designforhuman) excellent Medium post entitled [“New to Framer?
Just 3 Things to Get You Started”](https://medium.com/@designforhuman/new-to-framer-just-3-things-to-get-you-started-47397f27c71e#.80jvxpgm0)

## Basic Concepts

###Coffeescript

Framer is built upon Coffeescript, which is a simpler way of writing Javascript.

Coffescript, like many scripting languages, is built upon variables, conditions, functions, arrays, objects.

####Variables

````
// Javascript
number = 42;

# Coffescript
number = 42
````

````
// Javascript
opposite = true;

# Coffeescript
opposite = true
````

####Conditions

````
// Javascript
if(opposite) {
    number = -42;
}

# Coffescript
number = -42 if opposite
````

####Objects

````
// Javascript
addressBook = {
    firstName: "Michael",
    lastName: "Yap"
};

# Coffescript
addressBook =
     firstName: "Michael"
    lastName: "Yap"
````

####Arrays

````
// Javascript
shoppingList = [
    eggs,
    milk,
    bread
];

# Coffeescript
shoppingList = [
    eggs,
    milk,
    bread
]
````

####Functions

````
// Javascript
square = function(x) {
    return x * x;
}

# Coffeescript
square = (x) -> x * x
````

###Dot Notation

When you import a Sketch file into Framer, you'll see a new line similar to the one below.

`example = Framer.Importer.load “imported/example”`

In the real world, objects have properties. For example, take a red balloon. The balloon is the object; color is one of its properties; color is set to red. In Javascript, we can access an object's properties using dot notation.

````
# Access the the balloon's color and set it to blue
balloon.color = "blue"
````

To access and change properties of objects drawn in Sketch we can use dot notation to access nested objects.

For example, say you've drawn three circles in Sketch and you wish to change their size in Framer.

````
# Access circles via dot notation and update its scale property
example.circles.scale = 1.2
````
###Indentation

Just as dots are significant in Framer, so are indents.

Indents are used to indicate parent-child relationships.

````
function = ->
    layer.animate
        properties:
           opacity: 1
           rotation: 90
````

In the example above, `opacity` and `rotation` are children of `properties`.

`properties` is a child of `layer.animate`.

`layer.animate` is a child of `function`.

###Agency

Humans have the capacity to act by our own free will. We laugh. We love. We move through space. Walking in the woods, we brush (an event) a branch (an object) away from our face.The  branch bends (a state change).

In Framer, events, objects, and states are the key ingredients for creating interactive animated prototypes.

####Layers

We can think of objects we act upon in the real world as layers in Framer.

Framer's [documentation](http://framerjs.com/learn/basics/) defines a layer as:

> …a rectangle that draws elements. Layers can display images, videos or text. Every layer inherits a set of default properties: width, height and a blue background.

####States

Layers can have multiple states, or, different ways of appearing. In one state, a circle may appear small, in a subsequent state, it may appear large. Layers may switch from state-to-state with or without animation.

####Events

Interactivity lets objects on screen react to something a user does: moving a mouse over a navigation button produces a menu of links; selecting a radio button reveals a new set of form options; clicking a small photo makes the page darken and a larger version of the photo pop onto the screen.

User actions that a Framer prototype can respond to are called events.

To make your Framer prototype interactive, you write actions (functions) that respond to events.

Framer allows you to "listen" to many events: click events, touch events, scroll events, drag events and more.

````
# Listen listen to when the user clicks upon a layer name "layerA"
layerA.on Events.Click, ->
    # Awesome code here
````

One of the most comment uses of events toggling between a set of states on click

````
# Toggle states on click
menuButton.on Events.Click, ->
    menu.states.next()
````
